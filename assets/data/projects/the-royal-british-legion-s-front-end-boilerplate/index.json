Initially, BPL were contracted for the Legion’s marketing materials, campaigns and display advertising. As part of the formation of BPL Web; our in-house web design and development service, we inherited the Royal British Legion website from their previous, outsourced development team, and were tasked with handling ongoing design, development and maintenance efforts. I took on the task of refactoring the entire front end of the site. As part of this, I made large contributions to the Royal British Legion’s digital brand guidelines and designed and built a UI kit for their current and future web projects; the RBL Boilerplate. The Boilerplate consists of all necessary UI elements for the website, and was built and maintained in isolation from the main website, so it can serve as a dependency for the main site, as well as other satellite projects. We were able to offer the boilerplate as a package for other suppliers to use within projects not associated with BPL, whilst maintaining control of the components within it.</p><p>The RBL Boilerplate was designed to offer ease of use, with clear call to actions and a modular, readable layout. The design utilised high contrast ratios to ensure accessibility, and a modular codebase to ensure flexibility and scalability.</p><p>Aside from the RBL Boilerplate, I was responsible for all design and front end development work on the Royal British Legion website for 3.5 years, including annual campaigns, microsites and complex user interfaces for new functionality.</p>"}]}]}},"context":{"slug":"the-royal-british-legion-s-front-end-boilerplate"}}
