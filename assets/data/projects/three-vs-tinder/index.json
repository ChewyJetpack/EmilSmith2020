The concept was based on juxtaposing smartphones into historical events, to show how they might have turned out. In this case, Three and Tinder had built a campaign around King Henry VIII using Tinder to find his wives. We were briefed to build an interactive, responsive promotional landing page for their digital marketing campaign, funneling users to a competition entry form.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"/uploads/three1_885a90e0bf.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure><p>Our solution was an interactive mini-game written in Vue.js, named “The Swipe is Right”, in which users would operate a Henry-themed version of the Tinder app, swiping through pictures of his six wives. Players would need to swipe right on wives that survived, or left on wives that were beheaded or divorced, to reach the end of the game and access the competition entry page.</p><p>My role within this project included initial conceptual work, wireframes, hi-fi designs, and prototypes in Figma. I also built the front end in Vue.js, alongside a back end developer working in Laravel to handle the data, API, and security.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversion metrics were extremely positive - 76% of page visitors engaged with the Tinder game, and 54% of users converted via a competition entry form at the end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsImagesSlider","id":"6","title":"Three vs Tinder","images":[{"id":"76","url":"/uploads/three3_ac8661b2d2.jpg"},{"id":"77","url":"/uploads/three4_b3507a1ac1.jpg"},{"id":"78","url":"/uploads/three5_113fa2fd61.jpg"},{"id":"79","url":"/uploads/three2_49565f9441.jpg"},{"id":"80","url":"/uploads/three1_97da9f069a.jpg"}]}]}]}},"context":{"slug":"three-vs-tinder"}}
