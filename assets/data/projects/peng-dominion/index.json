I wanted to communicate a sense of authenticity, in contrast to what I perceived elsewhere in electronic music; a veil of professionalism and sleek design which seems anonymous and ingenuous. This is my response to that style, in that it is unashamedly genuine, and very personal.</p><p>I drew the artwork myself, through which I found a way to reconnect with my artistic past as a graffiti writer, before outlining in Illustrator and finishing in Photoshop. I also mastered all the releases myself. This entails using specialised processing techniques, and a keen ear, to give the music a final balance and sheen, and ensuring professional quality, loudness, and compatibility for distribution.</p><p>I work with a PR company called Cygnus Music to send releases out for pre-release promotion to A-list drum &amp; bass DJs, press, radio, blogs and print, before releasing in all digital stores, and consistently received an overwhelmingly positive response, with support in clubs and radio from top-tier DJs.</p><p>As I write this, Peng Dominion is currently on a hiatus, as I've taken some time away from the music game to re-work my creative process, but I plan on revisiting and revamping the label in future.&nbsp;</p>"},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsImagesSlider","id":"7","title":"Peng Dominion","images":[{"id":"84","url":"/uploads/peng1_32a9b984a6.jpg"},{"id":"85","url":"/uploads/peng3_261d7d7e1d.jpg"},{"id":"86","url":"/uploads/peng2_49057c38b5.jpg"},{"id":"87","url":"/uploads/peng4_fc17f66d39.jpg"}]}]}]}},"context":{"slug":"peng-dominion"}}
