Through our early concept meetings where various team members developed draft scripts, the team decided to run with my script.

In a time when people seem most divided, and when polarisation appears to trump rational discourse, it’s important for us to recognise each other as human beings; to be understanding, and to take the time to appreciate nuance, complexity, and even chaos. By taking the time to see the world through the eyes of others, we can learn to appreciate those who see things differently, rather than reject them.

This was one of the things that attracted me to this role, and it gave me a fantastic opportunity to take ownership of a large scale design project and attain a deep understanding of the product from the outset.</p><p>Over its 20+ year history, NewsNow has been under constant, iterative development. As with any long-term project, especially one that had started life in 1997, sooner or later a refactor becomes necessary. In this case, refactoring the design was equally as important as refactoring the codebase. Additionally, there were plans to develop large improvements to the product’s functionality, which would necessarily disrupt aspects of both the codebase and the design. The existing design was simply not flexible enough to accommodate these new developments, meaning that the product was in need of a fresh coat of paint, and maybe a slight rethink of the walls and foundations underneath, on which these new features could be built.</p><p>My role on this project was as the sole designer, front end developer (working as part of the development team), and to work alongside the COO and CEO on product management.</p><h3>Goals</h3><p>The new design would need to give the product a much needed aesthetic lift, bringing the look and feel in line with contemporary standards. The design would also need to adhere to accessibility standards to ensure good usability, and while we set no rigid rule on WCAG accessibility standards, we aimed for AA accessibility where possible. The design would also need to be modular, flexible, and scalable, to accommodate new and complex features later on. Finally, due to the diverse nature of the userbase, specifically those in English-speaking countries in the developing world, the product would need to retain its high level of browser compatibility, offering an improved experience to people browsing on feature phones, using Opera Mini with extreme data saving enabled.</p><h3>Approach</h3><h4>Research</h4><p>Embarking on a project of this scale, especially as a new member of the team, was no small feat. I took time to analyse the existing product in detail, speaking with members from all areas of the business, including development, editorial, and senior management, to get a full and comprehensive understanding of the business, the product, and the underlying technology.</p><p>Beyond this, I felt it important to look at the product in the wider context of the industry, to see how we might want to position ourselves relative to other news aggregators, publishers, and social platforms. NewsNow is unique in this sense; it is a news aggregator that performs similar functions to those by the likes of Google, Apple, and Yahoo, but the number of individual topics and the number of headlines on a given page is more akin to the likes of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit.&nbsp;</p><p>Reddit, specifically, shares many parallels with NewsNow. Firstly, the Information Architecture is inherently similar: Long feeds of headlines, for a near-endless variety of topics, algorithmically sorted and able to be reordered by chronology, popularity, or relevance. In addition, Reddit had also recently embarked on a large redesign project, moving away from a dense, text-based layout that had accumulated a dedicated and loyal userbase, just like that of NewsNow. On the basis of these parallels, I embarked on a competitor analysis project of sorts, to understand the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of Reddit’s redesign, charting their roadmap, digging up metrics, some of which were kindly supplied to me by subreddit moderators, and drawing actionable conclusions which we were able to implement in our own redesign process.&nbsp;</p><p>At this stage, I would have liked to conduct some user research, to build an understanding of user demographics, usage habits, motivations, and pain points, but unfortunately, this was not something that had been done on the product before, and thus a lack of time and resources made this impractical. We did, however, manage to conduct a series of user interviews prior to the initial roll-out, which helped inform some later design decisions.</p><h4>Roadmaps</h4><p>Equipped with the learnings from my research phase, I was able to work collaboratively with senior management to specify the scope and deliverables for the design project, and within the development team to create a scope and task backlog for the technical requirements. We used Asana to manage the project, in which I constructed a set of timelines with clear dependencies between design and development, accounting for testing and code cleanup, with a set launch date for our private, opt-in beta. We also took learnings from the Reddit case study to help inform our process, including the implementation of a system to manage user feedback, a public blog post to inform users of upcoming changes, and a staggered rollout to ensure feature-parity prior to the site-wide launch.</p><p>The nature of this project did not necessarily lend itself to a strict goal-setting framework, as it was not intended to drive any specific metric. Rather, the success of the project would be measured in our resulting ability to scale and develop the product in the future, and the retention of our core user base.&nbsp;</p><h4>Design</h4><p>The design strategy for this project was rather straightforward, conceptually. Firstly, I planned to employ atomic design principles to create a modular, component-based design system in Figma, with standardised tokens for measurements, colours, and typography, and context-agnostic, BEM-style components for all UI elements, templates, and pages. Secondly, the design would be carefully tested against WCAG accessibility guidelines to ensure that colour contrast ratios, font sizes, and interactive elements were sufficiently distinguished and usable.</p>"},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsLargeMedia","id":"3","media":{"id":"55","url":"/uploads/1_GA_0h_YK_7_Jt_Ir_Duk1_F1_Ia_Uk_Q_2bec920f1f.png","mime":"image/png"},"description":null},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"24","content":"<h4>Branding</h4><p>Fundamentally, the design would need to reflect NewsNow as a brand, which was a challenge in itself, since the business had not previously devoted much time to developing a formal brand identity. On this basis, I engaged with senior management over several brainstorming sessions to develop a preliminary brand guidelines document, which included the specification of brand values, identity, and ethos, as well as some visual elements such as typographic rules, a new colour palette, and logo guidelines. Of course, the visual aspects of this document were intended to be under constant evolution throughout the design process, the definition of the core brand values and identity was instrumental in subsequent design decisions.</p><h4>User Interface</h4><p>The NewsNow UI design posed a number of distinct challenges. Firstly, the site was almost entirely text-based; headlines were listed alongside publication names, with metadata such as timestamps and some interactive controls, but with no imagery. In addition, the site used relatively small font sizes and there was a high value attributed to content density. Users who had been using the site for many years had become accustomed to the deep, dense feeds of headlines, through which they could scan for new information on their areas of interest. On this basis, adjustments to headline fonts, font sizes, and overall density were, for the most part, off-limits. Secondly, the existing three-column layout (side-navigation, central content column, sidebar) was to be retained in its entirety. On this basis, modernising the look and feel of the product was to be achieved only in part by this project, and completed later with large-scale changes to the product format.</p><p>My approach to handling the limitations of the project, the richness of the product feature-set, and the need for radical future scalability, was to put together an atomic design system, which could be mirrored within the codebase, using modular components and substituting inheritance with modifiers. After auditing the existing codebase for all font sizes, colours, and other tokens, I developed a stripped-back list of basic building blocks, and gradually worked my way up through each level of the component structure, from buttons and icons up to page templates. From this, I re-created various page templates using the new components, to compare directly with their existing counterparts. Careful attention was paid to font-sizes and colour contrast ratios to ensure the site was accessible and usable.&nbsp;</p><p>After many rounds of presentation, feedback, iteration, and prototyping, I was given the green light by senior management to rally the development team and begin work on the build.</p>"},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsLargeMedia","id":"5","media":{"id":"56","url":"/uploads/1_6_S_Bpi_Or_H1_Nca_FVMY_Gfm9_w_d7d3ce1000.png","mime":"image/png"},"description":null},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"25","content":"<h4>Development</h4><p>Implementation of the new design was a months-long process for the development team at NewsNow. I was responsible for the majority of the front-end build, working closely with a full-stack software developer on templating in NewsNow’s bespoke, in-house, Perl-based templating system, SCSS, and JS. Components were developed to mirror the structure of the design system, using BEM syntax and isolated component templates.</p><p>The nature of the templating system necessitated constant collaboration with all members of the development team, as well as many remote, peer-programming sessions to work through various issues and code reviews. In addition to the new components, we heavily refactored large areas of the codebase to improve page load speeds and overall performance, as well as maintainability. We took time and care to evaluate and audit the existing code, selecting chunks for preservation, removal, or refactoring. Through this process we also identified features that had gone unused for months or years and were able to simplify the site functionality by pruning such features from the product.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond the overall implementation and refactor of the codebase, we also tested rigorously to ensure a high level of browser compatibility. The site is fully compatible with Opera Mini on feature phones, bar certain customisation features, and user accounts. Additionally, I devised a new alternative to the existing device-detection system which relied heavily on javascript and resulted in a complex matrix of site versions that required individual support. This system used a combination of media queries and support queries in CSS to accurately identify the devices needing special support, and unified site versions for other devices which previously had to be catered for individually, resulting in a much more easily maintainable system.</p><p>Beyond the development phase, we also devoted significant time to cleaning up the codebase, closing redundant issues, and removing unused code.&nbsp;</p><h4>User Engagement</h4><p>While user-research wasn’t within the scope of this project, I did endeavor to bring human-centred design thinking into the process as much as possible. Upon completion of our initial beta, I wrote up a Medium piece, outlining our redesign for our users, which we promoted alongside the limited, opt-in beta so that people who were offered the chance to take part in the beta were able to read about the changes being made, the reasoning behind those changes, and the positive impacts those changes were designed to make. In addition, those who took part in the beta were prompted for NPS-style ratings of the new design and offered the opportunity to give in-app feedback, for which we guaranteed a response from the team. Through this feedback mechanic, we were able to assemble a research panel of loyal NewsNow users who agreed to take part in upcoming research, and finally, we engaged with those users, as well as some people who were new to the site, in a round of in-person interviews, where we gathered qualitative information on their impressions and experiences whilst using the new site.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this process, we were able to gather valuable information which we used to iterate and improve on the design prior to our full launch, and it served as a valuable precedent for future research projects. We were also able to develop a previously absent rapport with our users; we responded to each and every piece of feedback we received, engaging directly with the people who used the product, and giving them the opportunity to contribute to the development of the product.</p>"},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsLargeMedia","id":"4","media":{"id":"58","url":"/uploads/1_i_r_VCFHW_05t8_Ay_OM_0_QG_3_RA_41116c4b76.png","mime":"image/png"},"description":null},{"__typename":"strapiTypes_ComponentSectionsRichText","id":"23","content":"<h3>Results</h3><p>Overall it is no understatement that this project was a resounding success.

Design methodology at NewsNow had traditionally been informed by engineering, along with A/B testing paradigms and voluntary user feedback. Existing understanding of the makeup of NewsNow’s userbase and their motivations had been inferred from A/B test results for features over a span of many years, and while this served as a valuable starting point, it was far from concrete.&nbsp;</p><p>There was, however, a large appetite within the team, including senior management, editorial and development team members, to better understand our users. Given this appetite, and a product roadmap brimming with large-scale design and development projects, it seemed right to make strides towards uncovering our userbase and giving our users a seat at the table. I put together a plan of action and advocated for human-centred design principles as part of a more efficient and effective product design and development process.</p><p>The initiative consisted of four components: “Identify”, “analyse”, “empathise\", and “realise”. Work on these components could be undertaken ad-hoc, spanning multiple projects. Our initial work on user research, as part of NewsNow’s redesign, helped to form the basis for this structure, and the subsequent steps were taken over the course of a project to design and develop a new core product.</p><h3>Identify</h3><p>This initial phase was primarily a data-gathering effort. We launched a site-wide demographic survey to a randomly selected subset of users, asking broad questions about people’s interests, usage habits, age, gender, location, and general news reading habits, with the goal of identifying both the general demographic makeup of our existing userbase, as well as our place within their news diet. The survey was implemented in Hotjar, and thus we were able to gather additional metadata for each submission, such as from which pages users submitted the survey and information about their device. In addition, Hotjar enabled us to collect responses from users who did not complete the full survey, which proved especially useful in looking for selection/response bias.</p><p>In addition to the survey, I also used Hotjar to generate a wide array of heatmaps, to look more specifically at how users on different topic categories might behave differently to one another.</p><p>Finally, I was able to gather quantitative data from Google Analytics to further understand device/browser/OS distribution, usage habits, and behaviour.</p><h3>Analyse</h3><p>The demographic survey generated approximately 6000 responses, which I exported as a CSV and processed in Google Sheets. I spent a long time sifting through all the responses, slicing the data in various ways and looking for patterns that might help me to uncover segments within the userbase. As part of this process, I weighted the responses by geography, and device category, using the Google Analytics data from the period of time in which the survey was active as a source of truth.</p><p>Upon applying weights to the data and segmenting by country, I discovered a number of very clear segments within our userbase. Focusing on what were, by far, the three largest segments; UK, US and Nigeria, I was able to identify vastly different distributions of age, topical interests, and device usage between the three groups. What was particularly interesting about this was that the demographics in each segment appeared somewhat narrow; we were appealing to specific age-ranges and categories of interest in each country that were distinct from one another, and that appeared unlikely to be representative of online news readership demographics as a whole. To validate this, I checked some publicly available data regarding online news readership from <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">Ofcom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/11/key-findings-about-the-online-news-landscape-in-america/\">Pew Research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/381569/leading-news-and-media-sites-usa-by-share-of-visits/\">Statista</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/united-states/category/sports\">SimilarWeb</a>. By checking our own data against these broader demographic insights, I was not only able to confirm the boundaries of our users’ segmentation but was also able to identify prominent demographics in the wider population, both in the UK and the US, that were underrepresented in the NewsNow userbase.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on my analysis of the survey results, analytics data, and third-party data, I was able to craft a handful of personas, representative of our core users. In addition, based on the demographics I had found to be under-represented, I created additional personas, representative of our target demographics, with the goal in mind of better serving these demographics and subsequently growing and diversifying the NewsNow userbase. I created a full writeup of my findings, including my methodology, data and charts, sources, and a summary of the results, which I presented to the wider team.&nbsp;</p><h3>Empathise</h3><p>The next step was to engage with real people, in-person, and begin to build a rapport with the people behind our personas. Through our earlier demographic survey, and through dedicated research participant recruitment services such as UserInterviews.com, we were able to work with users that were representative of all our user personas, from a range of backgrounds; from the UK, US and Nigeria.</p><p>The methodology for the interviews was based on a semi-structured interview format, which offered a relaxed atmosphere and an opportunity to build a rapport with participants, whilst still ensuring that all our talking points were covered. For the purposes of this round of interviews we had created a hi-fi Figma prototype of our new product, including multiple pages with varying degrees of interactivity, for mobile and desktop. In addition to the Figma prototype, we also had a working prototype running on a staging container, so users could experience the new product with real-world data.&nbsp;</p><p>Interviews were conducted on Lookback.io, recording video, audio, and notes, and lasting approximately 30 minutes, for which users were incentivised with Amazon vouchers. I lead all the interviews, with our UI designer observing and keeping notes. The process for each interview was to first understand a bit more about the participant; their interests, hobbies, news-reading habits, and a bit about their day-to-day life, to understand how our product might fit into their day. I would then show them the product, and ask for their first impressions and gut-feelings about the overall look, feel, and utility. Beyond that, participants were free to use and explore the product and were asked to try and vocalise their thoughts and actions as much as possible while they did so. I would answer questions, make notes of potential pain points, and occasionally offer some steer, either to ensure participants were able to cover all the talking points, or to help on the occasion that they got stuck with the prototype or the UX. At the end of each interview, I would sit down with our UI designer for a general recap, to discuss any points of interest, collate notes, and tag certain points of note in the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>Once all the interviews were complete, I worked with the design team to create a summary of our findings, as well as a highlights reel, containing the most interesting and useful clips of our interview recordings, grouped into categories, to offer colleagues and management a quick glimpse into the responses of our participants.</p><h3>Realise</h3><p>The overall results of this initiative were enlightening, challenging, and extremely positive. For the first time, we were able to understand and empathise with the NewsNow userbase in a personal way. We were shown which parts of our new product were working well, and in some cases even better than expected, as well as parts of the product that needed improvement. We were given a better understanding of how our product fit into the wider industry, how our users interpreted the brand against competitors, and how we might better serve a more diverse range of people in the future. We also found that some of our initial expectations were challenged: There were certain areas of the new product which we had been intending to make personalisable, or using algorithms to modulate aspects of the UI based on the user segment being served, but in fact we found that our users harmonised on certain aspects of the design, and that by executing certain aspects of the design well, we would negate the need for additional complexity. We were also able to re-prioritise our product roadmap, iron out some rough plans and add more specificity to design tasks in the backlog based on all the new insight we had attained.</p>"}]}]}},"context":{}}
